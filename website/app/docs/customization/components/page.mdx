# Components

Pass custom React components that become available in all MDX files without imports.

## Registering Components

```tsx title="docs.config.tsx"
import { MyCallout } from "./components/my-callout";
import { InfoCard } from "./components/info-card";

export default defineDocs({
  // ...
  components: {
    MyCallout,
    InfoCard,
  },
});
```

## Using in MDX

Once registered, components are available in any MDX file:

```mdx title="page.mdx"
<MyCallout type="warning">
  This component is available everywhere — no import needed.
</MyCallout>

<InfoCard title="Tip">
  Custom components keep your MDX clean.
</InfoCard>
```

## Overriding Built-in Components

You can override built-in components (like `Callout`) by registering a component with the same name:

```tsx
components: {
  Callout: MyCustomCallout,
},
```

## Component Props

Components receive their props as defined in your implementation. The only requirement is that they must be valid React components.

```tsx title="components/my-callout.tsx"
export function MyCallout({
  children,
  type = "info",
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  type?: "info" | "warning" | "error";
}) {
  return (
    <div className={`callout callout-${type}`}>
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}
```
