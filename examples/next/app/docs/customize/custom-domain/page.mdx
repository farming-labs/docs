Set up a custom domain so your docs are served from your own URL (e.g., `docs.yoursite.com`).

## DNS Configuration

Add a CNAME record pointing to your deployment:

```
Type: CNAME
Name: docs
Value: your-project.vercel.app
```

## Verifying Ownership

After adding the DNS record, verify ownership in your dashboard:

1. Navigate to **Settings → Domains**
2. Click **Add Domain**
3. Enter your custom domain
4. Wait for DNS propagation (usually under 5 minutes)

## SSL Certificates

SSL certificates are provisioned automatically. No manual configuration is needed.

## Subpath Routing

You can also serve docs from a subpath like `yoursite.com/docs`:

```ts
export default defineDocs({
  entry: "docs",
  basePath: "/docs",
});
```
