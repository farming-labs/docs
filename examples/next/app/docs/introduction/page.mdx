# Introduction

Learn the basics here. This guide covers core concepts and how everything fits together.

## What is @farming-labs/docs?

A modern, flexible MDX-based documentation framework with theme support. Inspired by Fumadocs, it lets you build beautiful docs with minimal configuration.

### Design Principles

- **Config-driven** — Behavior is defined in `docs.config.ts`, not scattered across files
- **Theme-aware** — Use the Fumadocs preset or build your own theme
- **Framework agnostic** — Core package works with Next.js, Vite, and more

## Core Concepts

### Entry

The `entry` in your config defines where docs live. Default is `"docs"`, so pages go in `app/docs/` and routes become `/docs`, `/docs/intro`, etc.

### Theme

Themes control colors, typography, layout, and component defaults. Use the Fumadocs preset:

```ts
theme: fumadocs({
  ui: {
    colors: { primary: "#22c55e" },
    components: { Callout: { variant: "outline" } },
  },
}),
```

### Metadata

Configure site-wide metadata and per-page overrides via frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "My Page"
description: "Page description"
tags: ["guide"]
---
```

## MDX Components

Write docs in MDX and use components like:

- **Callout** — Info, warning, and error boxes
- **CodeBlock** — Syntax-highlighted code with copy button
- **Tabs** — Tabbed content for multiple examples

All components come from the Fumadocs preset and can be customized in the theme config.

## Routing

Pages follow the file system. Each `page.mdx` in a folder becomes a route:

| File | URL |
|------|-----|
| `app/docs/page.mdx` | `/docs` |
| `app/docs/get-started/page.mdx` | `/docs/get-started` |
| `app/docs/guides/advanced/page.mdx` | `/docs/guides/advanced` |
