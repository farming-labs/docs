# Hidden Pages

Sometimes you need pages that are accessible via URL but hidden from the
sidebar navigation.

## Using Frontmatter

Add `hidden: true` to your page's frontmatter:

```mdx
---
title: Secret Page
hidden: true
---

This page won't appear in the sidebar.
```

## Use Cases

- **Draft content**: Pages still being written
- **Internal pages**: Content for specific audiences
- **Redirect targets**: Pages that only serve as redirect destinations
- **API callbacks**: Documentation for webhook endpoints

## Accessing Hidden Pages

Hidden pages are still accessible via their URL. You can link to them
from other pages:

```mdx
Check out our [internal guide](/docs/internal-guide) for more details.
```
