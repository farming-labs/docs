# Exclude Files

Control which files are included in your documentation build.

## Ignoring Directories

Files and directories starting with `_` or `.` are automatically ignored:

```
app/docs/
├── page.mdx          # ✅ Included
├── _drafts/          # ❌ Ignored
│   └── page.mdx
└── .internal/        # ❌ Ignored
    └── page.mdx
```

## Excluding from Search

To keep a page visible but exclude it from search results:

```mdx
---
title: My Page
searchable: false
---
```

## Excluding from Sitemap

```mdx
---
title: My Page
sitemap: false
---
```

## Best Practices

1. Use `_` prefix for work-in-progress content
2. Use `hidden` frontmatter for pages you want accessible but not in the sidebar
3. Use `searchable: false` for pages that shouldn't appear in search
