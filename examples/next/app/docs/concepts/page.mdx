# Concepts

Understanding these core concepts will help you get the most out of Better Auth and build robust authentication systems.

## Architecture Overview

Better Auth follows a layered architecture:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│          Client SDK (React, etc.)    │
├──────────────────────────────────────┤
│            API Handler               │
├──────────────────────────────────────┤
│          Auth Core Engine            │
├──────────────┬───────────────────────┤
│   Plugins    │   Database Adapter    │
└──────────────┴───────────────────────┘
```

1. **Client SDK** — Framework-specific hooks and utilities for the frontend
2. **API Handler** — HTTP endpoints that handle auth requests (sign in, sign up, etc.)
3. **Auth Core Engine** — The central logic that orchestrates authentication flows
4. **Plugins** — Optional modules that extend functionality (2FA, passkeys, etc.)
5. **Database Adapter** — Abstraction layer for your database of choice

## Key Concepts

### Auth Instance

The auth instance is the central object that configures your authentication system. It's created with `betterAuth()` and holds all configuration, plugins, and database connections.

### Sessions

Sessions represent an authenticated user's state. Better Auth uses secure, encrypted cookies to manage sessions automatically. Sessions can be configured with custom expiry times, refresh tokens, and more.

### Accounts

An account links a user to an authentication method. A single user can have multiple accounts (e.g., email + Google + GitHub), all linked to the same user profile.

### Verification

Verification tokens are used for email verification, password resets, and other flows that require proving ownership of an email address.
