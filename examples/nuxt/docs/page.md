# Introduction

Better Auth is a framework-agnostic, universal authentication and authorization framework for TypeScript. It provides a comprehensive set of features out of the box and includes a plugin ecosystem that simplifies adding advanced functionalities.

Whether you need 2FA, passkey, multi-tenancy, multi-session support, or even enterprise features like SSO — it lets you focus on building your application instead of reinventing the wheel.

## Features

Better Auth aims to be the most comprehensive auth library. It provides a wide range of features out of the box and allows you to extend it with plugins.

- **Framework Agnostic** — Support for most popular frameworks
- **Email & Password** — Built-in support for secure email and password authentication
- **Account & Session Management** — Manage user accounts and sessions with ease
- **Built-In Rate Limiter** — Built-in rate limiter with custom rules
- **Automatic Database Management** — Automatic database management and migrations
- **Social Sign-on** — Multiple social sign-on providers
- **Organization & Access Control** — Manage organizations and access control
- **Two Factor Authentication** — Secure your users with two factor authentication
- **Plugin Ecosystem** — Even more capabilities with plugins

...and much more!

## Why Better Auth?

Most existing auth libraries are either too minimal, requiring you to write everything from scratch, or too opinionated, locking you into a specific stack. Better Auth strikes the balance — it gives you a complete, production-ready auth system while remaining flexible enough to customize every aspect.

### Design Principles

1. **TypeScript First** — Full end-to-end type safety, from database schemas to API responses
2. **Framework Agnostic** — Works with Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit, Astro, Express, Hono, and more
3. **Database Agnostic** — Bring your own database — Prisma, Drizzle, Mongoose, or raw SQL
4. **Plugin Architecture** — Extend functionality without bloating the core
5. **Security First** — OWASP best practices, CSRF protection, rate limiting out of the box

## Quick Start

Get up and running in under 5 minutes:

```bash
npm install better-auth
```

```ts
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  database: {
    provider: "postgresql",
    url: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  },
  emailAndPassword: {
    enabled: true,
  },
});
```

That's it. You now have a fully working authentication system with email/password sign-in, session management, and more.
